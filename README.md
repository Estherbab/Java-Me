# Java-Me

## Description 
How well do I know Javascript Fundamentals? Well i will be creating a timed quiz that tests my Javascript fundamentals and stores my high scores which will help me gauge my progress in comparison to my peers. In this challenge my code quiz will be able to navigate through the start button onto the questions page, that will contain multiple choice Javascript questions. When the right or wrong answer is clicked an alert shows on the page confirming if you right or wrong as well as a corresponding sound is played to reflect if you got the question right or wrong. The marks are calculated by how fast you can answer the questions with the time given. And the quickest time becomes the highest scoring student.
